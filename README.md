The model helps in identifying trends, customer preferences, and potential areas for improvement, providing actionable solutions based on data-driven insights.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the raw customer data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides detailed visualizations and statistical summaries to understand data distribution and relationships.
- **Model Training**: Implements and trains machine learning models on customer data to predict outcomes and classify user behavior.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assesses model accuracy and performance using various metrics.
- **Insights and Solutions**: Offers tailored solutions and recommendations for improving customer satisfaction and business strategies.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and graphical representation of insights.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- **XGBoost**: For advanced gradient boosting algorithms to enhance model accuracy.
- **Joblib**: For saving and loading the trained model.

## Installation
